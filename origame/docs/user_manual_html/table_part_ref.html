<span id="table-part-ref"></span><h1>5.1.17. Table Part<a class="headerlink" href="#table-part" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h1>
<p>The table part is used to display, edit, and interact with the contents of a table in an embedded relational database. The table data can be accessed and changed by using either the table <a class="reference internal" href="notes.html#term-api"><span class="xref std std-term">API</span></a> via a linked function part or through the part&#8217;s editor panel. The embedded database is managed by SQLite statements that are generated by table part <a class="reference internal" href="notes.html#term-api"><span class="xref std std-term">API</span></a> commands or user interactions with the editor panel.  These commands allow the user to import from, or export to, Access database tables. They also provide an interface that can sort, filter, index, add, and remove database records and data fields. The table part also stores the names and data-types for the table fields.</p>
<p>Double-clicking the table part or right-clicking and selecting &#8220;Edit...&#8221; opens the editor dialog (see <a class="reference internal" href="using origame.html#ref-part-edit"><span class="std std-ref">Part Editing, and Undo, Redo Commands</span></a>) that displays the content shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-table-part-and-editor"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 5.17</span></a>, where the data in the table part can be manually edited. By clicking into the table fields the values can be changed directly.</p>
<p>Double-clicking a column header will open a dialog that can be used to change the column&#8217;s name and data type. The supported types include double, integer, and text. The column type can be changed at any time and automatically convert the current column values. Likewise, any time a value is manually entered into a column, the value is converted to the type specified by the column. If the values cannot be converted, another dialog will open stating that a &#8220;Data Type Error&#8221; occurred which means that current value(s) do not match the type expected by the column. These values will be highlighted in red and must be manually changed. While Origame will continue to funtion without issue if they are not changed, an export error may occur if the table contents are later exported to an Access database. Copying and pasting values between columns will also automatically convert the copied values to the type specified by the column.</p>
<p>The dialog provides the following data editing options:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Edit tab: tools to insert before or after (row if row selected, or column if column selected), select all, cut, copy, paste, delete, and sort,</li>
<li>Database tab: tools for filtering, importing and exporting, and indexing,</li>
<li>Size tab: tools for changing table dimensions.</li>
</ul>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 5.17 </span><span class="caption-text">The Table part and editor dialog.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Edit tab options become available or are disabled depending on how the table&#8217;s fields, rows, or columns are selected. If nothing is selected in the table, all Edit tab options, except <em>Select All</em> are disabled. The following list overviews which Edit options become available depending on what is selected in the table:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Insert Before</em> or <em>Insert After</em>: are active immediately and, for new tables without rows or columns, will insert one row at a time only. Once a table has been initialized with a set of rows, these buttons will insert a row if a row is selected or a column if a column is selected (or group of either) before or after the selected one. Rows and/or columns can be selected by either clicking the row number or column header, respectively, or left-clicking and dragging the mouse along the row or column to select. These buttons will deactivate if no cell, row, or column are selected. However, they automatically reactivate if all rows are removed in order that they may be used to insert new rows.</li>
<li><em>Cut</em>, <em>Copy</em>, <em>Paste</em>, <em>Delete</em>: are active if at least one cell has been selected and will also work on full or partial row or column selections. While copy works on the contents of the row(s) or column(s) selected, cut will remove the selected row(s) or column(s) entirely. The delete option will do the same things as cut if a full row or set of rows, or a full column or set of columns, is selected, otherwise, only the cell contents will be deleted. For copied contents, paste will paste the copied contents into the table (the dimensions of table must permit the entire copied selection to be pasted) starting at the location of the top left selected cell. For cut row(s) and column(s), paste will insert the cut row(s) or column(s) into the table at the selected row or column.</li>
<li><em>Sort</em>: is active only when an entire column is selected. Clicking <em>Sort</em> activates the sorting feature so that subsequently clicking on a column will toggle the sort from &#8220;as-created&#8221;, to &#8220;alphabetical&#8221;, to &#8220;reverse-alphabetical&#8221;. If the <em>Sort</em> button is clicked again, sorting will be disabled and the column will return to &#8220;as-created&#8221;. Sorted columns can be propagated to the table part in the Model View if editor changes are applied while sorting is active.</li>
<li><em>Select All</em>: always active.</li>
</ul>
<p>While all rows may be removed from a table, it must always have one column header. If all columns are selected and Delete is pressed, all table contents will be deleted, however, the default column header will be reinserted as the first column.</p>
<p>The Database tab also provides the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">The Filter button in the Database tab allows SQLite filter to be specified to limit the records shown in the table in accordance with the filter specified. For example, to filter all record entries for a specific column header called &#8220;Population&#8221;, to a specific value, click the Filter button to open the dialog and enter the filter string that specifies which column and what value to filter for: <em>Population=&#8217;value&#8217;</em>. The Refresh filter button can be pressed to reapply the filter if new records are added or existing records changed that do not satisfy the filter. The filter is applied only to the data in the editor until either the <em>OK</em> or <em>Apply</em> buttons are pressed, at which point, the filter is applied to the table part.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The Import and Export buttons provide a dialog to facilitate importing from, and exporting to, a table in an Access database file. When importing, data will be imported into the editor panel but won&#8217;t be propagated to the table part until <em>OK</em> or <em>Apply</em> is pressed. When exporting, the data in the editor will be exported to Access, not the data in the table part (which will be the same unless changes have been made to the data after the editor was opened). These options are also available from the part&#8217;s context menu. When importing or exporting from the context menu, the data in the table part is affected directly. Only Access <a class="reference internal" href="notes.html#term-mdb"><span class="xref std std-term">MDB</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="notes.html#term-accdb"><span class="xref std std-term">ACCDB</span></a> files are supported for both import and export operations, however, only <a class="reference internal" href="notes.html#term-mdb"><span class="xref std std-term">MDB</span></a> files can be created during export if a new database file is created.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>To import, use the dialog to select a database, and click the <em>List Tables</em> button to list its tables. Selecting a table from the drop down menu will show a list of fields in the table which can be selected or deselected for import. Additionally, an SQL &#8220;WHERE&#8221; clause can be entered in the last field in order to filter the results that are imported (the clause does not require the SQL statement &#8220;SELECT something FROM table WHERE...&#8221;, only the conditions required to import specific values from specific columns). If you click OK, the editor&#8217;s current table data will be completely discarded, the chosen fields are added, and the table populated with data from the chosen MS Access database.</li>
<li>To export, use the dialog to select an MS Access database to export to. If the database exists, you may also list its tables and select the table to export to. The default table shown in the list is a new table that will be created in the database. If an existing table is selected, its contents will be replaced with the exported table upon completion of the export operation. There is no way of appending data to an existing MS Access table. You may also select or deselect the fields of Table Part Editor to export. Note that if a filter has been added to the table part editor, then it will be shown in the dialog as a non-editable field and will be applied to the exported table.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The Index button opens a dialog that enables column indexing. The dialog allows the user to build a list of indexes, where each row in the list represents a new index, and each index is a list of column names. The dialog facilitates adding and removing indexes. After the index is created, the indexed columns appear with an asterisk (*) inserted to the right of the column name.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Size tab provides two spin boxes to increase or decrease the table dimensions by using either the up or down scroll buttons on the right of the box or by typing the new value directly. The table dimensions will change when either <em>Enter</em> or <em>Return</em> are pressed or the mouse clicks elsewhere in the editor. <strong>Note that if the row or column size is reduced, the contents of those fields are lost unless the editor panel is closed or cancelled and changes discarded. The values of removed rows or columns cannot be retrieved by increasing the size dimension after it has been decreased</strong>.</p>
<p>Clicking on Part Help opens this page.</p>
