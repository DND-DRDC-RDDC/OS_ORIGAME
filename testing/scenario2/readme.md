# Test Scenario 2

This scenario runs a 50-year, 4 replication simulation of a 4-rank career progression model with scheduled training and promotion requirements.

## Additional Dependencies


The test scenario contained in "Test model 2022-07-18.ori" requires a python package in addition to the standard packages used by ORIGAME: pandas-0.20.1.

Install this dependency from the command line using pip (located in the .../Python35/Scripts folder):

```sh
pip install pandas-0.20.1
```


## Run Procedure


Open the scenario "Test model 2022-07-18.ori" in ORIGAME and execute a batch simulation using the settings provided.

The scenario is pre-populated with input settings found in the Excel file "OCC_InitialPopulation.xls". If the setup function is run again then update the path to the input settings .xls file in "OCC_4Ranks_IntakeSurge.pca" and load this setup file when promted by ORIGAME.

After the run completes, the batch simulation output will have been saved to a "batch_results.sqlite.db" file in the folder created by the batch run.

## Test Acceptance


For any new version of ORIGAME, this test is successful if running the scenario produces a batch results file that exactly matches the included "batch_results 2022-07-18.sqlite.db" file that was generated by the current version of ORIGAME using the seeds found in the included "RandomSeeds_4reps_1var.csv" file.
