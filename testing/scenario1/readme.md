# Test Scenario 1

This scenario runs a 50-year, 5-replication simulation of a hypothetical personnel system with regular and reserve components, 4 ranks, and a schedule of tasks.

## Run Procedure

Open the scenario "Test model 2022-07-13.ori" in ORIGAME and execute a batch simulation using the settings provided.

After the run completes, the batch simulation output will have been saved to a "batch_results.sqlite.db" file in the folder created by the batch run.

## Test Acceptance

For any new version of ORIGAME, this test is successful if running the scenario produces a batch results file that exactly matches the included "batch_results 2022-07-14.sqlite.db" file that was generated by the current version of ORIGAME using the seeds found in the included "seeds.csv" file.
